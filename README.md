# MasterMind

Mastermind is a two-player code-breaking game where one player, the code-maker, creates a secret code using a series of colored pegs, and the other player, the code-breaker, tries to guess the code within a limited number of attempts. The game typically comes with a board with four rows of holes, where the code-maker places four colored pegs in a specific order, with the possibility of using duplicates.

The code-breaker makes a guess by placing four colored pegs in the same order on the same board. The code-maker provides feedback by placing smaller pegs in either white or black color in the feedback row. A black peg indicates that the code-breaker has guessed the correct color and position, while a white peg indicates that the code-breaker has guessed the correct color but in the wrong position.

The code-breaker then uses this feedback to adjust their next guess, using a process of elimination to deduce the correct code. The game continues until the code-breaker correctly guesses the code or until the maximum number of attempts is reached.

Mastermind is a challenging game that requires logical thinking, deductive reasoning, and strategic planning. It is suitable for players of all ages and can be played in about 15-30 minutes.
